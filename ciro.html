					<p>Tiefling Sorcerer</p>
					<p>Age 20 </p>
					<p>A cheerful and charming Tiefling who likes being the centre of attention.  </p>
					<p>Has decided to leave his hometown and his guild to find his long-lost brother. </p>
					<p>His Story </p>
					<p>Ciro Gold grew up in Sandglider Town. As a kid, he lived with his older brother Krovardos and his mother Celia. Their mother was a highly ranked Sorcerer specializing in fire magic. Due to her fascination for fire, she came into contact with a fire demon. She later on had both of her Tiefling sons.  </p>
					<p>Krovardos wasn’t particularly popular around town, due to his demon father. Most of the other Sorcerers of his mother’s guild were afraid of him and advised Celia not to teach him how to use his fire powers. She therefor decided to wait till he’d start using his powers on his own. Krovardos never seemed to show any interest in fire, until his brother was born.  </p>
					<p>Ciro was born when Krovardos was six. Unlike Krovardos, Ciro started playing with fire before he could walk or talk, and the guild decided he should be trained before he burned down the city. Due to Ciro’s powers Krovardos started questioning his own powers and decided to try on his own. He quickly discovered that he had fire powers like his brother, but he didn’t tell his mother and started trying on his own.  He was ten when the guild discovered his powers. Krovardos had been training on his own and had accidently set fire to a couple of buildings. This made even more unpopular with the guild, than the fact that he was a Tiefling. Despite the incident the guild started training Krovardos as well. He was a lot less talented than his younger brother, but with time he got a hang of all the basics.  </p>
					<p>Both the people of Sandglider Town and the guild weren’t particularly fond of the Tiefling brothers. People were scared of them and Krovardos felt that. At the age of seventeen he said goodbye to his brother and left the town.  </p>
					<p>Ciro wasn’t very close with his brother due to both the age gap, and the fact that he had had a very tight schedule with constant lessons, and he didn’t quite understand the situation. As he grew up, he started understanding his role in the city, and started feeling the hate from the people. At some point when he was eighteen, he started understanding why Krovardos had left him so many years ago. He then decided to leave the guild in search for his brother.  </p>
